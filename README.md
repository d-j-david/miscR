# miscR

This package contains functions which simplify tasks I commonly perform. I
have simplified them either because base R has no equivalent, or the
equivalent has confusing and/or difficult to remember syntax.

This package can be accessed directly from R, without any additional coercion. 
Simply copy and paste the following commands into your R console and run:

install.packages("devtools")  
devtools::install_github("d-j-david/miscR")  
library(miscR)
